    <h1>PRECIOUS TIMES</h1>

    <h3>Childhood Years</h3>
    <p>
        <sup>1</sup>My name is Gab, and I was born and raised in Manila. 
        <sup>2</sup>I remember when I was in preschool, my grandmother used to escort me to the nursery school. 
        <sup>3</sup>I cannot recall if I did well in my studies, but I still remember the fun times when I had a tutor. 
        <sup>4</sup>I was a playful kid and had a really short attention span, so I guess my tutor had a hard time teaching me. 
        <sup>5</sup>After preschool, I was taken to the province to get my primary education. 
        <sup>6</sup>I only studied there for 1st grade, but there were a lot of memories. 
        <sup>7</sup>All the friends I made used to play with me within our relatives' compound. 
        <sup>8</sup>I remember the wounds I had when we played <em>chase, hide and seek, and capture the flag</em>. 
        <sup>9</sup>Back then, I did not have any technology. 
        <sup>10</sup>All I had were toys and books, but most of the time I just played with my toys. 
        <sup>11</sup>Another fun memory is when my grandmother told me to sleep during the afternoon so I could grow tall. 
        <sup>12</sup>However, I always ended up sneaking out of the house to play with my cousins. 
        <sup>13</sup>When I finished 1st grade, my parents took me back to Manila to study at the University of the East. 
        <sup>14</sup>During my first day I was scared and nervous because I had more classmates than in the province. 
        <sup>15</sup>I managed to make friends with a guy whom I cannot remember now, but we were good friends. 
        <sup>16</sup>After 2nd grade, I met this girl whom I am now still friends with till this day. 
        <sup>17</sup>This girl became like an older sister for me. 
        <sup>18</sup>I also got into a circle of friends that were nice and playful like me. 
        <sup>19</sup>My education back then was pretty good, but I remember <strong>failing art</strong> because I am not creative. 
        <sup>20</sup>A lot of teachers said I had wasted potential because of my attention span.
    </p>

    <h3>Teenage Years</h3>
    <p>
        <sup>1</sup>At the start of 7th grade, I was nervous because I didn't know anyone. 
        <sup>2</sup>I am an <strong>introverted</strong> teenager by nature. 
        <sup>3</sup>I can talk to people well if they start the conversation first. 
        <sup>4</sup>Luckily, the girl I’m friends with was my classmate again. 
        <sup>5</sup>Since I’m trying to get to know more people, I tried sitting with others in my row. 
        <sup>6</sup>I was very talkative, so the teacher transferred my seat to the last row. 
        <sup>7</sup>Most of my teenage years revolved around school, which gave me the best memories. 
        <sup>8</sup>I used to enjoy all the projects when the whole section was involved. 
        <sup>9</sup>The rehearsal and preparation of props and costumes were always so fun. 
        <sup>10</sup>During 8th grade, I had a new circle of friends that became my family. 
        <sup>11</sup>We created memes and posted them on a Facebook page that gathered ten thousand followers. 
        <sup>12</sup>Outside of school, I had a subgroup of friends who were huge <em>anime fans</em>. 
        <sup>13</sup>On a random week, it was announced that we would have a suspension due to a virus. 
        <sup>14</sup>When online classes started, I was unfamiliar since it was my first laptop. 
        <sup>15</sup>During that time, I became the president of a club. 
        <sup>16</sup>I tried my best to be among the <mark>With Honors</mark> students, which I actually achieved. 
        <sup>17</sup>In 12th grade, I started to take my life seriously and started going to the gym. 
        <sup>18</sup>I started having a fixed routine and a very organized schedule. 
        <sup>19</sup>I managed to finish senior high school and graduate as an ‘Honor’ student. 
        <sup>20</sup>I am grateful to make my parents get up the stage during my graduation.
    </p>

    <h3>College Years</h3>
    <p>
        <sup>1</sup>Entering my college year was terrifying and also very stressful at first. 
        <sup>2</sup>Although I was an ICT student, I was not confident with my programming knowledge. 
        <sup>3</sup>I was nervous that college topics would be far too complex for me. 
        <sup>4</sup>Luckily, it was not that hard, and most lessons were continuations of senior high. 
        <sup>5</sup>During my 1st year, my schedule allowed me to go to the gym and study. 
        <sup>6</sup>I learned things that became very interesting, like different programming languages. 
        <sup>7</sup>I was fascinated by how many languages can create similar programs. 
        <sup>8</sup>The history subject was also very interesting because of our professor. 
        <sup>9</sup>I didn’t join many organizations because I wanted to focus on my tasks. 
        <sup>10</sup>However, I did enjoy my <strong>NSTP program</strong> in civic welfare. 
        <sup>11</sup>I had a sense of purpose while helping the community. 
        <sup>12</sup>My PATHFIT classes were also a lot of fun for me. 
        <sup>13</sup>Sometimes we watched sports competitions which felt like a hangout. 
        <sup>14</sup>After my 1st year, things got a bit more complicated with the schedule. 
        <sup>15</sup>I had a lot of unnecessary vacancies and late evening dismissals. 
        <sup>16</sup>I used the vacant time to study and prepare for upcoming quizzes. 
        <sup>17</sup>My PATHFIT was enjoyable because the coach complimented my movement. 
        <sup>18</sup>My academic situation is decent, except for <em>Discrete Mathematics</em>. 
        <sup>19</sup>I was always bad at math, but thankfully I passed the subject. 
        <sup>20</sup>Hopefully, I will pass this 2nd semester despite the tiring schedule.
